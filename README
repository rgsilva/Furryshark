Furryshark
----------

Furryshark is a simple application that interfaces with Grooveshark servers by
using HTTP requests passing JSON-encoded objects. Grooveshark's website does
exactly the same thing, but using JavaScript and Flash to request the information.
What I'm doing with this project is try to reproduce their behavior, creating a 
cross-platform desktop application for it.

Requirements
------------

- Qt4
- Qjson	(http://qjson.sourceforge.net/)

TO DO
-----

- Play and/or download songs.
- Improve the UI.
- Consider token expire time.
- Maybe auto-update GS password (it's somewhere in their JS files)

Disclaimer
----------

This is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY. Whatever you do with this application or
its code it's YOUR and ONLY YOURS responsibility. I created this project mainly
by reverse engineering Grooveshark's communication using sniffers and browser's
developer tools. They can change the entire website internal protocol any day,
so this code can be obsolete at any time without any kind of warning. Of course,
I'll try to keep this as much updated as I can, and I hope some people can help
with this project.

So, please, feel free to fork this project! :)
