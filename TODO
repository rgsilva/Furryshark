TO DO
-----

- Error support:

a) I need to do something related to errors in the communication between the server and the client. For example, if I can't get a PHPSESSID right now, I should keep trying or present the user a nice error. For now I believe it tries twice, since in Germany is a little bit complicated to get it to work.

b) Consider the case when the token expires.

- Direct playback support:

So you don't have to download the song to play it ;)

- Improve the UI:

Meh. Maybe some better download management, better general UI, who knows?

- Auto-update password

This is complicated. To extract the password from a JS file is easy, but not from the flash. I saw some scripts that do this anyway.
